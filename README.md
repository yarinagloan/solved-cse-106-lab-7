Add a SQL database to the web application you developed in Lab 5 and 6 so your backend service saves to a database instead of a JSON file. Use SQLAlchemy as an ORM to interface with the Flask app REST API you created previously. By way of reminder, your program should do the following, while persistently saving the data to a database:

<ul>

 <li>Allow a user to ask for a grade from the database and display the grade, given the student name</li>

 <li>Allow the user to see all students and grades in the database</li>

 <li>Allow a user to create a new student name and grade in the database</li>

 <li>Allow a user to edit a grade in the database</li>

 <li>Allow a user to delete a grade in the database</li>

</ul>
